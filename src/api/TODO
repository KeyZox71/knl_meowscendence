Todo :
- view friend's activity status
- add a privacy setting so not anybody can GET friends, match history, etc. (what are the RGPD requirements ?) ?
- test updated score storing (delays)



User API :
POST /users/:userId/avatar	+ {image} (calls POST /images, stores returned imageId in DB at :userId)
GET /users/:userId/avatar	-> {image}
DELETE /users/:userId/avatar	(calls DELETE /images/:imageId, clears imageId in DB at :userId)
PATCH /users/:userId/avatar	+ {image} (emulates a DELETE /users/:userId/avatar and a POST /users/:userId/avatar) -> use uMember instead ?
- provide a random kanel image from Adam's website ?

Image API :
- convert everything to webp (using @fastify/sharp)
- test size max



Always update API docs
