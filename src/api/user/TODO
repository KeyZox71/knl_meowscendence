Todo :
- create users with an avatar (by default) -> POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE avatar
- create a whole image upload API that ensures files are not executables, converts to a single type, stores the image and returns a UID to address them
- add a privacy setting so not anybody can GET friends, match history, etc. (what are the RGPD requirements ?) ?



Always update API doc
